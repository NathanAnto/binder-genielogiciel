# Binder

Binder is a web application project created for the Software Engineering Course in HES-SO Valais-Wallis third ISC semester program.

With Binder, users can effortlessly browse a curated selection of available titles, each accompanied by a brief recommendation, a mini book description, and a personalized fit index to help match readers with their ideal books.

Users have the flexibility to manage their reading choices, including the ability to return books before the booking period ends and access a history of their past bookings. Additionally, users can track their reading statistics on a dedicated stats page.

For administrators, Binder offers comprehensive tools to oversee the book collection. Admins can add, remove, hide, and search for titles, as well as analyze user interactions through detailed statistics for both individual users and the overall book collection.
